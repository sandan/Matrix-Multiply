Cache optimized matrix multiply
To compile and run:
./compile

reports the results in a file called report.
The program runs a check using the naive matrix multiplication.
The matrix should be able to handle valid matrices of any dimension.
The implementation uses an interleaved blocking technique where the windows
and computations are interleaved instead of blocking for each dimension and then
computing.
