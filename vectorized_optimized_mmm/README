Cache optimized and vectorized (using SSE4.2 extensions) matrix multiply

To compile and run:
./v_compile

The results are output in a file report for that run.
The matrix implementation should handle valid matrices of 
any dimension. This is a simple extension of the cache optimized
matrix multiply.
